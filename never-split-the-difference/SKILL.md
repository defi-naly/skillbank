# Never Split the Difference

Negotiation principles from FBI hostage negotiation, adapted for business and communication.

## Core Principle: Tactical Empathy

Negotiation is not about logic—it's about emotions and the other party feeling understood.

**Tactical empathy** = Understanding the feelings and mindset of another in the moment, and hearing what's behind those feelings.

Goal: Get them to say **"That's right"** (they feel understood), not "You're right" (they want you to go away).

## The Toolkit

### 1. Mirroring

Repeat the last 1-3 words (or critical words) of what someone said, with upward inflection.

**Why it works**: Creates connection, encourages elaboration, buys time.

**Example**:
- Them: "We can't do that price."
- You: "Can't do that price?"
- Them: [Explains the real constraint]

Use silence after mirroring. Let them fill the space.

### 2. Labeling

Name the emotion or dynamic you observe. Format: "It seems like..." / "It sounds like..." / "It looks like..."

**Why it works**: Diffuses negative emotions, reinforces positive ones.

**Examples**:
- "It seems like you're frustrated with the timeline."
- "It sounds like this decision has a lot riding on it."
- "It looks like you've been burned by vendors before."

Never say "I understand"—it's dismissive. Label specifically instead.

### 3. The Accusation Audit

List every negative thing the counterpart could think about you, upfront.

**Why it works**: Defuses objections before they're raised, builds trust.

**Format**: "You probably think [negative assumption]. You might be wondering [concern]. It may seem like [bad interpretation]."

**Example** (cold outreach):
> "You're probably thinking this is another sales pitch. You might be wondering why I'm reaching out when you already have a solution. You may even think I haven't done my research..."

Anchor their expectations low so reality exceeds them.

### 4. Calibrated Questions

Open-ended questions starting with "How" or "What" that make them solve your problem.

**Power questions**:
- "How am I supposed to do that?"
- "What's the biggest challenge you face?"
- "How does this fit into your priorities?"
- "What happens if we don't do this?"
- "How would you like me to proceed?"

**Avoid "Why"**: It sounds accusatory. Reframe as "What" instead.
- Not: "Why did you do that?"
- Better: "What caused you to do that?"

### 5. "No" is the Start

**Getting to "No"** is often more valuable than getting to "Yes."

- "No" makes people feel safe and in control
- A fast "Yes" is often fake (just trying to end conversation)
- Aim for "No" to surface real objections

**Technique**: Ask questions designed to get "No":
- "Is it a ridiculous idea to...?"
- "Have you given up on this project?"
- "Would it be a bad idea if...?"

### 6. The Late-Night FM DJ Voice

Calm, slow, downward-inflecting tone signals control and safety.

Use when:
- Tensions are high
- You need to slow things down
- Making a firm statement

Contrast with:
- **Playful/positive voice**: Default for building rapport
- **Direct/assertive voice**: Rare, for establishing boundaries

## Black Swans

**Black swans** = Unknown unknowns that change everything if discovered.

Every negotiation has 3-5 pieces of information that would change everything.

How to find them:
- Listen for inconsistencies
- Ask "What would make this a perfect deal for you?"
- Pay attention to what they don't say
- Notice when emotion doesn't match words

Common black swans:
- They have a deadline you don't know about
- There's internal politics constraining them
- They value something you haven't surfaced
- They have an alternative you're unaware of

## Anchoring

**Extreme anchors** move the negotiation range.

Techniques:
- **Ackerman model**: Start at 65% → 85% → 95% → 100% of target, with decreasing increments
- **Pivot to non-monetary terms**: If price is stuck, negotiate scope, timeline, terms
- **Let them anchor first** (when you have less information)

When anchored against:
- Don't counter-anchor immediately
- Label: "It seems like you have a number in mind based on something I'm not seeing."
- Ask calibrated questions: "How did you arrive at that?"

## Handling "That's too expensive"

Never defend or justify price immediately.

Response sequence:
1. Mirror: "Too expensive?"
2. Label: "It seems like price is the main concern here."
3. Calibrated question: "What would you need to see to feel comfortable with this investment?"

Or use: "What does 'too expensive' mean to you?"

## Application by Context

### Pricing/Sales
- Lead with accusation audit (address objections preemptively)
- Use calibrated questions to understand their constraints
- Anchor high, concede strategically using Ackerman
- Find black swans: "What would make this a no-brainer?"

### Conflict/Difficult Conversations
- Mirror to slow down and gather information
- Label emotions before addressing substance
- Aim for "That's right" before proposing solutions
- Use calibrated questions to make them own the solution

### Written Communication (Email/Copy)
- Open with accusation audit
- Use labeling language ("You might be thinking...")
- End with calibrated question
- Keep it short—long emails don't get read

### Partnership/Deal Negotiation
- Discover black swans early through deep listening
- Use "How am I supposed to do that?" to push back softly
- Get them to "No" on unreasonable terms
- Aim for implementation focus: "How will we make sure this works?"

## Quick Reference

| Technique | Format | Use When |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Mirroring | Repeat 1-3 words + silence | Need info, build rapport |
| Labeling | "It seems like..." | Emotion present, need to diffuse |
| Accusation Audit | List negatives upfront | Cold outreach, tension expected |
| Calibrated Questions | "How/What..." | Need them to solve your problem |
| Getting to No | "Would it be terrible if..." | "Yes" feels cheap or fake |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Compromising/Splitting the difference** → Leaves value on table, no one satisfied
- **"I understand"** → Dismissive, use labels instead
- **"Why" questions** → Feels accusatory
- **Defending price immediately** → Shows weakness
- **Talking too much** → You learn nothing, they don't feel heard
- **Accepting first offer** → Always negotiate, even if offer seems good
