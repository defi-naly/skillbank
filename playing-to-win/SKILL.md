# Playing to Win Strategy Framework

## The Strategy Cascade

Strategy is an integrated set of choices that positions a business to win. Five choices cascade from top to bottom, each constraining and enabling the next:

```
1. WINNING ASPIRATION ──► What does winning look like?
         │
         ▼
2. WHERE TO PLAY ──────► Which markets, segments, channels, geographies?
         │
         ▼
3. HOW TO WIN ─────────► What's our competitive advantage?
         │
         ▼
4. CAPABILITIES ───────► What must we be great at?
         │
         ▼
5. MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ─► What processes reinforce our choices?
```

## The Five Choices

### 1. Winning Aspiration
Define what "winning" means - not vague mission statements but concrete outcomes.

**Good**: "Be the #1 or #2 brand in every category we compete in"
**Bad**: "Maximize shareholder value" or "Be the best company"

Questions:
- What does winning look like for our customers?
- How will we know we've won?
- What's our purpose beyond profit?

### 2. Where to Play
Choices about the playing field: geographies, products, channels, customer segments, vertical stages.

**Choosing where NOT to play is as important as where to play.**

Dimensions:
- **Geography**: Which countries/regions?
- **Product/Service**: Which categories/offerings?
- **Customer Segment**: Which buyers? (demographics, needs, behaviors)
- **Channel**: How do we reach customers?
- **Vertical Stage**: Which parts of the value chain?

Warning: "Everywhere" is not a strategy. Narrow focus enables concentrated resources.

### 3. How to Win
The specific approach to winning in chosen markets. Only two generic strategies exist:

| Strategy | Definition | Key Lever |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Cost Leadership** | Produce at lowest cost | Scale, efficiency, process |
| **Differentiation** | Create unique value worth premium | Innovation, brand, experience |

Being "stuck in the middle" = no strategy.

Questions:
- Why will customers choose us over alternatives?
- What's our sustainable advantage?
- Can competitors easily copy this?

### 4. Capabilities
The reinforcing activities that deliver the "how to win." Must be:
- **Activity systems** - not single capabilities but integrated sets
- **Mutually reinforcing** - each capability strengthens others
- **Hard to replicate** - competitors can't easily copy the whole system

P&G's capability system example:
- Deep consumer understanding
- Brand building
- Innovation
- Go-to-market ability
- Global scale

### 5. Management Systems
Processes, structures, and measures that support and reinforce choices:
- Strategic planning rhythms
- Performance metrics aligned to strategy
- Resource allocation processes
- Talent development systems

## Strategic Logic Flow

When analyzing or building strategy, test the logic:

```
IF we have [capabilities] AND [management systems]
THEN we can [how to win]
IN [where to play]
TO ACHIEVE [winning aspiration]
```

Each level must logically enable the one above.

## Common Strategy Traps

| Trap | Problem | Fix |
|------|---------|-----|
| **Do-it-all** | Trying to serve everyone | Make explicit where-to-play choices |
| **Don Quixote** | Attacking where competitors are strongest | Find uncontested or weakly-defended spaces |
| **Waterloo** | Fighting on too many fronts | Concentrate resources |
| **Something-for-everyone** | No clear differentiation | Choose cost OR differentiation |
| **Dreams-that-never-come-true** | Aspirations without supporting choices | Work backward from capabilities |

## Reverse Engineering Competitor Strategy

Apply the cascade to competitors:
1. What's their implied winning aspiration?
2. Where are they choosing to play?
3. How are they trying to win?
4. What capabilities enable this?
5. What systems reinforce it?

## Application Checklist

When developing strategy:
- [ ] Winning aspiration is concrete and measurable
- [ ] Where to play makes explicit trade-offs
- [ ] How to win is either cost leadership OR differentiation
- [ ] Capabilities form a reinforcing system
- [ ] Management systems measure and reinforce choices
- [ ] All five choices are internally consistent
- [ ] Choices are different from competitors

When evaluating strategy:
- [ ] Can articulate all five levels clearly
- [ ] Each level logically supports the one above
- [ ] Choices are genuinely hard to copy as a system
- [ ] Organization understands and executes the choices
