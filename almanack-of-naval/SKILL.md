# The Almanack of Naval

Principles for building wealth and finding happiness from Naval Ravikant.

## Wealth vs Money vs Status

**Wealth** = Assets that earn while you sleep. Freedom.

**Money** = How we transfer wealth. Tool.

**Status** = Your rank in social hierarchy. Zero-sum game.

**Key insight**: Seek wealth, not money or status. Status games are zero-sum and make you bitter. Wealth creation is positive-sum.

## How to Get Rich (Without Getting Lucky)

### 1. Own Equity

You won't get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain financial freedom.

**Time-for-money traps**:
- Salary caps your upside
- You're replaceable
- No compound growth
- Trading finite resource (time) for money

**Equity paths**:
- Start a business
- Join early-stage companies for equity
- Create intellectual property
- Build products with zero marginal cost

### 2. Specific Knowledge

Knowledge that cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can replace you.

**Characteristics**:
- Feels like play to you, looks like work to others
- Found by pursuing genuine curiosity
- Often at the intersection of fields
- Built through apprenticeship, not school

**Examples**:
- Deep technical + domain expertise combination
- Unique taste or judgment in a field
- Rare skill combinations (coding + design + sales)

**Question**: "What do I know or do that feels easy to me but hard to others?"

### 3. Accountability

Take business risks under your own name. Society rewards those who take responsibility.

**Accountability = leverage**:
- Builds reputation (portable)
- Attracts opportunities
- Compounds over time
- Requires courage (downside is visible)

**Contrast**: Hiding in committees, anonymous work, blaming others—no upside capture.

### 4. Leverage

Leverage magnifies your outputs without magnifying inputs.

**Three types of leverage**:

| Type | Description | Permission Required |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Labor** | People working for you | Yes (managing humans is hard) |
| **Capital** | Money working for you | Yes (need to raise/earn it) |
| **Products** | Code/media with zero marginal cost | No (permissionless) |

**Prioritize permissionless leverage**: Code and media. Write once, sell forever. No gatekeepers.

**New leverage formula**: Specific knowledge + accountability + leverage (especially code/media) = wealth

### 5. Judgment

Knowing the long-term consequences of your actions. The most important skill.

**Judgment comes from**:
- Experience (especially failures)
- Learning foundational concepts (not news)
- Mental models from multiple disciplines
- Clear thinking (meditation, reading, solitude)

**High judgment** = high hourly rate. People pay for decisions, not labor.

## The Hourly Rate Heuristic

Set an aspirational hourly rate. Outsource/ignore anything below it.

**Example**: If target is $500/hr:
- Don't mow your lawn ($50/hr task)
- Don't optimize for $100 savings
- Don't take meetings with unclear value

**Why it works**: Forces prioritization. Your time is your ultimate resource.

**Caution**: Don't use this to avoid learning new skills that will raise your rate.

## Compound Growth

Play long-term games with long-term people.

**Compounding applies to**:
- Relationships (trust builds over time)
- Knowledge (foundations enable advanced learning)
- Reputation (track record compounds)
- Wealth (returns compound)

**Implication**: Optimize for the long term. Don't burn relationships for short-term gain. Don't take shortcuts that sacrifice reputation.

**Rule**: All returns in life come from compound interest.

## Happiness Principles

### Happiness Is a Skill

Happiness is not something you find. It's something you develop through:
- Desire reduction (wanting less)
- Acceptance (of the present moment)
- Health (foundation for everything)
- Freedom (from obligations, anger, fear)

### Desire Is Suffering

Every desire is a contract with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.

**Solution**: Reduce desires. Want fewer things. Appreciate what you have.

**Not**: Achieve all desires (treadmill).

### Peace Is Happiness at Rest

**Happiness** = Positive state, peaks and fades.
**Peace** = Absence of negative, sustainable.

Optimize for peace over happiness spikes.

### The Mind Is a Single-Player Game

All benefits and suffering are in your head. External world is neutral.

**Implication**:
- You can change your experience by changing your mind
- Meditation, journaling, therapy = high ROI
- Stop blaming externals

## Decision Making

### Clear Thinking

The quality of your decisions determines the quality of your life.

**Enemies of clear thinking**:
- Ego (protecting self-image)
- Emotions (short-term reactivity)
- Social pressure (wanting approval)
- Complexity (not understanding fundamentals)

**Aids to clear thinking**:
- First principles (strip to basics)
- Inversion (what would guarantee failure?)
- Long time horizons (how does this look in 10 years?)
- Solitude (your own thoughts, not others')

### Easy Choices, Hard Life

If you're evenly split on a decision, take the harder path.

**Why**: Your brain overweights short-term difficulty. The harder path usually has less competition and more growth.

### If You Can't Decide, the Answer Is No

When faced with two equal options, choose the one with less downside, or neither.

**Why**: Modern life has too many options. Saying no to most things gives you time for what matters.

## Application Checklist

When evaluating opportunities or career moves:

1. [ ] Does this build specific knowledge I can't be trained for?
2. [ ] Do I own equity or just trade time for money?
3. [ ] Am I taking accountability under my own name?
4. [ ] What leverage am I using? (labor/capital/products)
5. [ ] Does this compound over time?
6. [ ] Am I playing long-term games with long-term people?
7. [ ] Does this increase or decrease my freedom?
8. [ ] Would I do this if I couldn't tell anyone?

## Anti-Patterns

- **"I'll get rich then get happy"** → Happiness is a skill, not a destination
- **"Working hard = success"** → Without leverage, hard work has linear returns
- **Renting out time to highest bidder** → Capped upside, no equity
- **Status games** → Zero-sum, makes you bitter
- **Following credentials** → Specific knowledge can't be certified
- **Short-term optimization** → Destroys compounding
- **Wanting more** → Desire treadmill, never satisfied
