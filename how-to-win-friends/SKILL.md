# How to Win Friends and Influence People

## Core Philosophy

You can't win an argument. Even if you "win," you lose—because you've made the other person feel inferior and resentful. The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.

**Fundamental truth**: People are not creatures of logic. They are creatures of emotion, motivated by pride and vanity.

## Part 1: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People

### Principle 1: Don't Criticize, Condemn, or Complain

Criticism is futile because it puts people on the defensive and makes them strive to justify themselves.

```
CRITICISM ──► DEFENSIVENESS ──► RESENTMENT ──► NO CHANGE
```

**Why it fails:**
- Wounds pride and sense of importance
- Triggers defensive justification
- Breeds resentment, not improvement
- The person criticized rarely changes

**Instead:**
- Try to understand why they did what they did
- Ask "What would I have done in their circumstances?"
- Empathy disarms where criticism escalates

**Lincoln's rule**: "Don't criticize them; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances."

### Principle 2: Give Honest and Sincere Appreciation

The deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important.

| Flattery | Appreciation |
|----------|--------------|
| Insincere | Sincere |
| Selfish | Unselfish |
| From the teeth out | From the heart |
| Universally condemned | Universally craved |

**The difference matters**: People can smell insincerity. Genuine appreciation requires actually finding something to appreciate.

**Practice**: Every day, look for specific things to genuinely appreciate in others. Be "hearty in approbation and lavish in praise."

### Principle 3: Arouse in the Other Person an Eager Want

The only way to influence people is to talk about what THEY want and show them how to get it.

**Before any interaction, ask:**
- What does this person want?
- How can I make them want to do what I'm suggesting?
- What's in it for them?

**Example transformation:**
- ❌ "I want you to work overtime"
- ✅ "This project could showcase your skills to leadership"

## Part 2: Six Ways to Make People Like You

### 1. Become Genuinely Interested in Other People

You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in others than in two years trying to get others interested in you.

**Actions:**
- Remember birthdays and important dates
- Learn about their interests, family, challenges
- Follow up on things they've mentioned
- Show interest through questions, not statements

### 2. Smile

A smile says: "I like you. You make me happy. I'm glad to see you."

**The effect is real:**
- Changes your own mood (feedback loop)
- Makes others more receptive
- Disarms hostility
- Costs nothing, creates much

**Even on the phone**: People can hear a smile.

### 3. Remember That a Person's Name Is the Sweetest Sound

Names are the sweetest and most important sound in any language.

**Techniques:**
- Use their name immediately after hearing it
- Associate it with something visual
- Repeat it during conversation (naturally)
- Write it down after meeting

**In communication**: Use their name periodically—it commands attention and shows respect.

### 4. Be a Good Listener. Encourage Others to Talk About Themselves

To be interesting, be interested.

**The attentive listener:**
- Maintains eye contact
- Asks follow-up questions
- Doesn't interrupt
- Shows genuine curiosity
- Remembers details for later

**Most people don't listen**—they wait for their turn to talk. This is your competitive advantage.

### 5. Talk in Terms of the Other Person's Interests

Find out what matters to them, then discuss that.

**Before meetings:**
- Research their background
- Discover their passions
- Prepare questions about their interests
- Find genuine points of connection

### 6. Make the Other Person Feel Important—and Do It Sincerely

The desire to be important is one of the deepest human drives.

**Phrases that work:**
- "I'd value your opinion on..."
- "You're the expert here..."
- "I've heard great things about your work on..."
- "I don't know how you manage to..."

**Rule**: Always make the other person feel important. Every person is superior to you in some way—learn from them.

## Part 3: How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking

### 1. Avoid Arguments

```
You Win Argument ──► They Lose Face ──► Resentment ──► You Lose Relationship
```

**When you feel an argument brewing:**
- Welcome the disagreement (maybe you're wrong)
- Distrust your first instinct to defend
- Control your temper
- Listen first
- Look for areas of agreement
- Thank them for their interest
- Postpone action to think

### 2. Show Respect for Others' Opinions. Never Say "You're Wrong"

"You're wrong" strikes at their pride, intelligence, and judgment.

**Instead:**
- "I may be wrong. I frequently am. Let's examine the facts."
- "I see it differently. Here's why..."
- "That's an interesting perspective. Have you considered...?"

### 3. If You're Wrong, Admit It Quickly and Emphatically

Say about yourself all the critical things you know the other person is thinking—and say them before they can.

**Benefits:**
- Disarms the other person
- Generates forgiveness
- Builds trust and respect
- Often prompts them to defend you

### 4. Begin in a Friendly Way

A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.

**Start with:**
- Appreciation
- Common ground
- Understanding of their position
- Warmth and friendliness

**Never start with:** Demands, criticism, or confrontation.

### 5. Get the Other Person Saying "Yes, Yes" Immediately

Start with points of agreement. Get them saying "yes" from the beginning.

**The psychology:**
- "Yes" creates forward momentum
- "No" creates psychological resistance
- Each "yes" makes the next one easier

**Socratic method**: Ask questions that lead to agreement, step by step.

### 6. Let the Other Person Do a Great Deal of the Talking

Most people trying to win others to their way of thinking do too much talking.

**Let them talk:**
- They know their problems better than you
- They feel ownership of ideas they express
- You learn what really matters to them
- They feel heard and respected

### 7. Let the Other Person Feel the Idea Is Theirs

No one likes to be sold or told what to do. Everyone likes to act on their own ideas.

**Technique:**
- Ask questions that lead them to the conclusion
- Offer suggestions, not directives
- "What do you think about...?"
- "How would you handle...?"

### 8. Try Honestly to See Things from the Other Person's Point of View

Ask: "Why would they feel this way? What's their perspective?"

**Always consider:**
- Their background and experiences
- Their pressures and incentives
- Their fears and desires
- What makes sense from their position

### 9. Be Sympathetic with Others' Ideas and Desires

The magic phrase: "I don't blame you one bit for feeling as you do. If I were you, I'd feel exactly the same way."

**This:**
- Validates their feelings
- Reduces defensiveness
- Opens dialogue
- Is almost always true

### 10. Appeal to Nobler Motives

People have two reasons for doing things: one that sounds good, and the real one.

**Appeal to the noble reason:**
- "I know you're someone who values fairness..."
- "Given your reputation for quality..."
- "Because I know integrity matters to you..."

### 11. Dramatize Your Ideas

Make your points vivid and memorable.

**Techniques:**
- Use demonstrations
- Tell stories
- Create visuals
- Make it concrete, not abstract

### 12. Throw Down a Challenge

The desire to excel motivates people powerfully.

**Stimulate competition:**
- Set goals and track progress
- Create friendly contests
- Appeal to their desire to prove themselves
- Make work a game

## Part 4: Be a Leader—How to Change People Without Giving Offense

### 1. Begin with Praise and Honest Appreciation

Start with what they're doing RIGHT before addressing what needs improvement.

### 2. Call Attention to Mistakes Indirectly

Don't say "but"—it negates the praise.

- ❌ "You did great, BUT..."
- ✅ "You did great, AND if you also..."

### 3. Talk About Your Own Mistakes First

"I've made this same mistake many times myself..."

This makes criticism feel like shared learning, not judgment.

### 4. Ask Questions Instead of Giving Direct Orders

- ❌ "Do this."
- ✅ "What do you think about...?"
- ✅ "Do you think this might work?"
- ✅ "What would happen if...?"

**Questions:**
- Stimulate creativity
- Give ownership
- Preserve dignity
- Generate better solutions

### 5. Let the Other Person Save Face

Never publicly embarrass anyone. Ever.

**Even when you're right:**
- Correct privately
- Soften the blow
- Preserve their dignity
- Give them an out

### 6. Praise Every Improvement

Be "hearty in approbation and lavish in praise."

**Specific > General:**
- ❌ "Good job"
- ✅ "The way you handled that difficult customer showed real patience"

### 7. Give the Person a Fine Reputation to Live Up To

"You're known for your attention to detail..."

People tend to act in accordance with the reputation you give them.

### 8. Use Encouragement. Make the Fault Seem Easy to Correct

"You're so close—just this small adjustment and you'll have it."

Make them feel that the thing you want them to do is easy.

### 9. Make the Other Person Happy About Doing What You Suggest

**Ask:**
- What benefit can they get from doing this?
- Can you match the request to their interests?
- What recognition or reward is possible?
