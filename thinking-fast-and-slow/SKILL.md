# Thinking, Fast and Slow Framework

## The Two Systems

The mind operates through two distinct modes of thinking:

```
SYSTEM 1 (Fast)              SYSTEM 2 (Slow)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Automatic                    Effortful
Unconscious                  Conscious
Fast                         Slow
Parallel processing          Serial processing
Associative                  Rule-based
Skilled/habitual             Flexible
Effortless                   Controlled
Pattern recognition          Logical reasoning
Always on                    Lazy, avoids work
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Key insight**: System 1 generates impressions, intuitions, and feelings. System 2 endorses, rationalizes, or overrides them. Most of our judgments and choices originate in System 1.

## WYSIATI: What You See Is All There Is

System 1 constructs the best possible story from available information. It doesn't flag missing information—it works with what it has.

**Consequences:**
- Overconfidence: Coherent story = high confidence (regardless of quality of evidence)
- Framing effects: Same information, different presentation = different conclusions
- Base-rate neglect: Vivid specifics override statistical reality
- Jumping to conclusions: Fast, but prone to error

**Defense**: Ask "What would I need to know to change my mind?" and "What information am I missing?"

## Cognitive Biases & Heuristics

### Anchoring
The first number you encounter heavily influences subsequent estimates.

| Scenario | Anchor Effect |
|----------|--------------|
| Negotiation | First offer sets the range |
| Pricing | Original price makes discount seem larger |
| Estimation | Random numbers affect "rational" estimates |

**Defense**: Consider the opposite. Generate your own anchor first. Ask "If this anchor didn't exist, what would I estimate?"

### Availability Heuristic
Probability judgments based on how easily examples come to mind.

**Leads to:**
- Overweighting recent, vivid, or emotional events
- Underweighting statistical base rates
- Risk perception driven by media coverage, not actual frequency

**Defense**: Ask "Am I judging frequency, or just memorability?" Seek base rate data.

### Representativeness Heuristic
Judging probability by similarity to stereotypes, ignoring base rates.

**Example**: "Steve is meek, tidy, needs order, and has a passion for detail. Is he a librarian or a farmer?"

Most say librarian—but there are 20x more male farmers than librarians. The base rate dominates.

**Defense**: Always ask "What's the base rate?" before considering the specific case.

### Substitution
When facing a hard question, System 1 substitutes an easier one.

| Target Question | Substituted Question |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| How happy are you with life? | What's my mood right now? |
| Should I invest in this stock? | Do I like this company? |
| How likely is this project to succeed? | Can I imagine it succeeding? |

**Defense**: Identify the actual question. Resist the easy substitute.

## Prospect Theory

People don't evaluate outcomes absolutely—they evaluate gains and losses relative to a reference point.

```
                VALUE
                  │
                  │      Gains
                  │    ╱
                  │   ╱
                  │  ╱ (diminishing sensitivity)
                  │ ╱
──────────────────┼──────────────────► OUTCOME
                 ╱│
                ╱ │
               ╱  │
              ╱   │  Losses
             ╱    │  (steeper = loss aversion)
                  │
```

### Key Principles

**1. Reference Dependence**
Outcomes coded as gains/losses relative to reference point (status quo, expectation, aspiration).

**2. Loss Aversion**
Losses loom larger than equivalent gains. Ratio ≈ 2:1.
- Losing $100 hurts about 2x as much as gaining $100 feels good
- Explains risk aversion for gains, risk seeking for losses
- Explains endowment effect (owning something increases its value to you)

**3. Diminishing Sensitivity**
The difference between $100 and $200 feels larger than between $1,100 and $1,200.

### Four-Fold Pattern of Risk Attitudes

|  | GAINS | LOSSES |
|--|-------|--------|
| **High probability** | Risk AVERSE (take the sure gain) | Risk SEEKING (gamble to avoid sure loss) |
| **Low probability** | Risk SEEKING (lottery tickets) | Risk AVERSE (insurance) |

This explains why people buy both lottery tickets AND insurance.

## Overconfidence

The most significant cognitive bias. Manifests in three forms:

**1. Overestimation**
Thinking you're better than you are.
- 90% of drivers think they're above average
- Entrepreneurs overestimate success probability

**2. Overplacement**
Thinking you're better than others.
- Easy tasks: overplacement common
- Hard tasks: underplacement common (everyone assumes they're bad)

**3. Overprecision**
Excessive certainty in accuracy of beliefs.
- 90% confidence intervals contain truth ~50% of the time
- Experts often no better than novices at calibration

**Defense**: Use reference class forecasting. Track your predictions. Widen confidence intervals.

## Planning Fallacy

Systematic underestimation of time, costs, and risks; overestimation of benefits.

**Why it persists:**
- Focus on the specific case, not the reference class
- Anchoring on best-case scenarios
- WYSIATI: don't consider what could go wrong

**Reference Class Forecasting (the cure):**
1. Identify appropriate reference class
2. Obtain statistics of that class
3. Use as baseline
4. Adjust for specifics of current case (minimally!)

**Example**: Don't estimate "how long will MY kitchen renovation take?" Ask "How long do kitchen renovations typically take?" (Answer: almost always longer than estimated.)

## The Halo Effect

Global evaluation (like/dislike) influences perception of specific traits.

```
"I like the CEO" ──► "Their strategy must be good"
"The product succeeded" ──► "The decision was wise" (even if it was lucky)
"They're attractive" ──► "They must be competent"
```

**Defense**: Evaluate traits independently. Collect judgments from multiple people before discussion.

## Hindsight Bias

"I knew it all along" after learning the outcome.

**Problems:**
- Makes us overestimate predictability of events
- Prevents learning from surprises
- Unfair to decision-makers ("obvious" in hindsight)

**Defense**: Record predictions BEFORE outcomes. Conduct pre-mortems, not just post-mortems.

## Regression to the Mean

Extreme performance is followed by less extreme performance—not because of causation, but statistical inevitability.

**Misinterpretations:**
- "Punishment works better than praise" (performance naturally regresses after extremes)
- "The Sports Illustrated cover jinx"
- "Treatment worked!" (patient was measured at their worst)

**Defense**: Expect regression. Don't over-explain it with causal stories.

## Pre-Mortem Technique

Before starting a project, imagine it has failed. Ask: "What went wrong?"

**Benefits:**
- Overcomes groupthink
- Legitimizes doubt
- Surfaces risks that optimism suppresses
- Uses prospective hindsight

## Application Framework

When making decisions:

### 1. Identify System 1 Signals
- Strong intuition or gut feeling?
- Immediate answer that "feels right"?
- Emotional response?

### 2. Engage System 2 Checks
- [ ] What's the base rate for this type of outcome?
- [ ] What information am I missing? (WYSIATI)
- [ ] Am I anchored on an irrelevant number?
- [ ] Am I substituting an easier question?
- [ ] What's the reference class forecast?
- [ ] What would a pre-mortem reveal?

### 3. Calibrate Confidence
- [ ] Would I bet money at these odds?
- [ ] Widen your confidence interval
- [ ] Remember: coherence ≠ truth

### 4. Protect Against Loss Aversion
- [ ] Am I avoiding a wise risk because losses loom large?
- [ ] Would I take this deal if framed differently?
- [ ] Evaluate gains and losses by their actual size, not their feeling

## Quick Reference: Common Biases

| Bias | Definition | Trigger Question |
|------|------------|------------------|
| Anchoring | First number influences estimates | "What's my anchor? Ignore it." |
| Availability | Easy to recall = seems common | "Memorable or actually frequent?" |
| Representativeness | Similarity over base rates | "What's the base rate?" |
| WYSIATI | Conclusions from incomplete data | "What's missing?" |
| Loss Aversion | Losses hurt 2x gains | "Am I overweighting potential loss?" |
| Overconfidence | Excessive certainty | "What's my track record?" |
| Planning Fallacy | Underestimate time/cost | "What's the reference class?" |
| Halo Effect | Global impression bleeds to specifics | "Am I conflating traits?" |
| Hindsight | "Knew it all along" | "Could I have predicted this before?" |
| Sunk Cost | Past investment influences future | "Would I choose this if starting fresh?" |
