# Zero to One Thinking

Apply these principles when building new products or evaluating opportunities.

## Core Framework

**0→1 vs 1→n**: Determine which mode applies:
- **0→1 (Creation)**: Building something that doesn't exist. Requires conviction, contrarian thinking.
- **1→n (Iteration)**: Copying/improving what exists. Requires execution, competition.

Always ask: "Is this creating new value or redistributing existing value?"

## The Contrarian Question

Before building, answer: **"What important truth do few people agree with you on?"**

Format the answer as: "Most people believe X, but the truth is Y."

If you can't articulate a contrarian truth, the idea is likely 1→n, not 0→1.

## Monopoly vs Competition

**Goal**: Build a monopoly, not a competitor.

Monopoly characteristics:
- Proprietary technology (10x better, not 2x)
- Network effects (product improves with users)
- Economies of scale (stronger as you grow)
- Branding (defensible identity)

**Red flags** (competitive thinking):
- Defining market broadly to seem unique ("we're the only X that does Y and Z")
- Comparing to competitors as positioning
- Racing on features rather than creating category

**Good sign**: Market so small competitors ignore it, but it can expand.

## Secrets

Every great business is built on a secret—something true that most people don't see.

Two types:
- **Secrets about nature**: Undiscovered scientific/technical truths
- **Secrets about people**: Things people hide or don't know about themselves

Where to look for secrets:
- What are people not allowed to talk about?
- What's forbidden or taboo?
- What do experts dismiss that might be real?
- What fields are under-explored?

## Power Law Thinking

Outcomes follow power laws, not normal distributions.

Implications:
- One investment/product/decision will matter more than all others combined
- Don't diversify thinking—concentrate on what could be huge
- The best opportunity won't look like the "average good opportunity"

Questions to ask:
- "Could this be the one thing that matters?"
- "What would have to be true for this to be 10x, not 10%?"

## Definite vs Indefinite Thinking

| | **Optimistic** | **Pessimistic** |
|---|---|---|
| **Definite** | Plan and build the future | Prepare for specific decline |
| **Indefinite** | "Things will improve somehow" | "Things will decline somehow" |

**Prefer definite optimism**: Have a specific vision and build toward it. Indefinite thinking leads to option-hoarding and incrementalism.

Symptoms of indefinite thinking:
- Over-reliance on A/B testing vs conviction
- Building "platforms" without specific use cases
- Keeping options open rather than committing

## Distribution Matters

Product doesn't sell itself. For every product, answer:
- What's the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)?
- What's the Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)?
- What distribution channel fits this ratio?

Distribution spectrum:
- **Viral** (CAC ~$0): Product spreads through use
- **Marketing** (CAC $1-100): Broad reach, low touch
- **Sales** (CAC $1K-100K): Relationship-driven
- **Complex sales** (CAC $100K+): CEO-level deals, multi-year

Most products fail on distribution, not product.

## Application Checklist

When evaluating an idea or building a product:

1. [ ] Can I articulate a contrarian truth behind this?
2. [ ] Is this 0→1 (new) or 1→n (better)?
3. [ ] What's the secret only I/we see?
4. [ ] Can this become a monopoly? Through what mechanism?
5. [ ] Does this have power-law potential?
6. [ ] Do I have a definite vision, not just optionality?
7. [ ] What's the distribution strategy?

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid these traps:

- **"We'll figure out monetization later"** → Indefinite thinking
- **"We're like Uber for X"** → 1→n imitation, no secret
- **"We compete on price"** → Commodity, not monopoly
- **"The market is $100B, we just need 1%"** → Broad market = competition
- **"We're agile, we'll pivot"** → No conviction, no secret
