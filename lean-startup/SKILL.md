# The Lean Startup Framework

## Core Philosophy

A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.

**The fundamental problem**: We build things nobody wants. Traditional planning fails because we can't predict the future in uncertain environments.

**The solution**: Treat every product decision as a hypothesis to be tested, not a feature to be built.

## The Build-Measure-Learn Loop

    └─────────────┘

```

**Goal**: Minimize TOTAL time through the loop. Speed of learning determines success, not speed of building.

## Validated Learning

The unit of progress for a startup is validated learning—demonstrated through empirical data that you've discovered something true about your customers.

**Validated learning is:**
- Backed by empirical data from real customers
- Demonstrated, not just believed
- Useful for building a sustainable business

**Questions to answer:**
1. Do customers recognize they have the problem?
2. If there was a solution, would they buy it?
3. Would they buy it from us?
4. Can we build a solution?

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The MVP is the version of the product that enables a full turn of the Build-Measure-Learn loop with minimum effort and minimum development time.

### MVP Types

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Landing Page** | Describe product, measure signups | Testing demand |
| **Video MVP** | Demo the concept (Dropbox style) | Complex products |
| **Concierge** | Manual delivery of automated service | Testing value prop |
| **Wizard of Oz** | Appears automated, humans behind scenes | Testing UX |
| **Piecemeal** | Existing tools stitched together | Testing workflow |
| **Single Feature** | One feature, done well | Testing core value |

### MVP Rules

1. **Remove any feature that doesn't contribute to learning**
2. **Ship faster than you're comfortable with**
3. **Quality only matters where it affects learning**
4. **If it doesn't have customers, it's not an MVP—it's a prototype**

**Common mistake**: Building too much. If you're not embarrassed by v1, you launched too late.

## Pivot or Persevere

A pivot is a structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy, or engine of growth.

### When to Pivot

**Signs you need to pivot:**
- Experiments show diminishing effectiveness
- Product development becomes less productive
- General feeling that things should be further along

**The pivot meeting**: Regular meetings (monthly/quarterly) to ask:
- Are we making sufficient progress toward our vision?
- Is our hypothesis validated or invalidated?

### Types of Pivots

| Pivot | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Zoom-in** | Single feature becomes whole product | Flickr (gaming → photos) |
| **Zoom-out** | Whole product becomes single feature | — |
| **Customer Segment** | Same product, different customers | — |
| **Customer Need** | Same customers, different problem | — |
| **Platform** | Application → Platform or reverse | — |
| **Business Architecture** | High margin/low volume ↔ low margin/high volume | — |
| **Value Capture** | Change monetization model | — |
| **Engine of Growth** | Viral ↔ Sticky ↔ Paid | — |
| **Channel** | Change distribution mechanism | — |
| **Technology** | Same solution, different tech | — |

**A pivot is NOT:**
- Random change
- Giving up
- Starting over
- Just a "tweak"

**A pivot IS:**
- Strategic hypothesis change
- Keeping one foot planted (vision)
- Structured experimentation

## Innovation Accounting

Traditional accounting doesn't work for startups. You need metrics that prove you're learning and building a sustainable business.

### Three Learning Milestones

1. **Establish the baseline**: Build MVP, measure current state
2. **Tune the engine**: Experiments to improve metrics toward ideal
3. **Pivot or persevere**: If metrics not improving, pivot

### Actionable vs Vanity Metrics

| Vanity Metrics | Actionable Metrics |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Total users | Active users |
| Page views | Conversion rate |
| Downloads | Retention rate |
| "Hits" | Revenue per user |
| Press mentions | Customer acquisition cost |
| Features shipped | Lifetime value |

**Test for actionable metrics:**
- Can it change behavior?
- Is it accessible and understandable?
- Is it auditable (can we verify it's true)?

### Cohort Analysis

Don't look at cumulative totals. Track cohorts (groups of users by time period) to see if metrics are actually improving.

```
         Signup │ Week 1 │ Week 2 │ Week 3 │ Week 4
         ───────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────
Jan cohort  100 │   40%  │   25%  │   20%  │   18%
Feb cohort  150 │   45%  │   30%  │   25%  │   22%  ◄── Are we improving?
Mar cohort  200 │   50%  │   35%  │   28%  │   ???
```

### A/B Testing

Every feature is a hypothesis. Test it.

**Rules:**
- Test one variable at a time
- Ensure statistical significance
- Pre-define success criteria
- Don't peek early and declare victory

## Engines of Growth

How startups achieve sustainable growth. Each requires different metrics and strategies.

### 1. Sticky Engine

Growth through retention. New customers exceed churned customers.

```
Growth Rate = New Customer Rate - Churn Rate
```

**Focus on:**
- Reducing churn
- Increasing engagement
- Building habits
- Switching costs

### 2. Viral Engine

Growth through customers recruiting more customers.

```
Viral Coefficient = Invites × Conversion Rate
```

If viral coefficient > 1, exponential growth. If < 1, growth stalls.

**Focus on:**
- Making sharing natural
- Reducing friction in referral
- Incentivizing both referrer and referred

### 3. Paid Engine

Growth through paid customer acquisition.

```
Sustainable if: Customer Lifetime Value > Customer Acquisition Cost
```

**Focus on:**
- Increasing LTV (upsells, retention, price)
- Decreasing CAC (better targeting, conversion)
- Optimizing channels

## Small Batches

Work in the smallest batches possible.

**Benefits:**
- Problems detected earlier
- Less wasted work when pivoting
- Faster learning cycles
- Reduced risk

**Example**: Instead of spending 6 months building, spend 2 weeks on MVP, learn, iterate.

## The Five Whys

Root cause analysis for problems. Ask "Why?" five times.

```
Problem: Customers are churning
Why? → They don't use the product after signup
Why? → They don't understand how to use it
Why? → Onboarding is confusing
Why? → We added features without updating onboarding
Why? → No process to update onboarding with new features
```

**Fix the root cause**, not the symptom.

**Rule**: Make proportional investment. Small problem = small fix. Big problem = big fix.

## Lean Startup in Practice

### Before Building Anything

1. **State your hypothesis explicitly**
   - "We believe [customer segment] has [problem]"
   - "We believe [solution] will solve [problem]"
   - "We'll know we're right when we see [metric]"

2. **Define your riskiest assumption**
   - What must be true for this to work?
   - What's the biggest unknown?

3. **Design the minimum experiment to test it**
   - What's the fastest way to learn?
   - What can we NOT build?

### During Development

- Track actionable metrics, not vanity metrics
- Run experiments, not just build features
- Use cohort analysis to measure true progress
- Have regular pivot-or-persevere meetings

### Decision Framework

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Is this a leap-of-faith assumption?     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                          │
              ┌───────────┴───────────┐
              ▼                       ▼
             YES                      NO
              │                       │
              ▼                       ▼
     Design experiment          Just build it
     to test assumption         (low risk)
              │
              ▼
     Build smallest possible MVP
              │
              ▼
     Measure with actionable metrics
              │
              ▼
     Learn: Was hypothesis validated?
              │
         ┌────┴────┐
         ▼         ▼
        YES        NO
         │         │
         ▼         ▼
     Continue    Pivot
```

## Key Mantras

| Mantra | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| "Get out of the building" | Talk to customers, don't guess |
| "Build to learn, not to scale" | MVP purpose is learning |
| "Fail fast" | Quick small failures beat slow big ones |
| "Optimize for learning" | Speed of learning = competitive advantage |
| "Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, cash is king" | But learning precedes all |
